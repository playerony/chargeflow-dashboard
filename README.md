# chargeflow dashboard

Firstly I was focused on setuping entire project, so here we have (Maintainability first approach):

- **biome** as a blazingly fast rust-based formatter and linter,
- **vite** for code bunding,
- **vitest** works nice with vite in order to write simple tests (I didn't wrote any xD),
- **testing-library** nice stuff to make tests for your hooks and components,
- **commitlint** in order to apprach some commit name standard,
- **lint-staged** in order to reformat code before each commit,
